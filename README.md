# Queute

Queute is a simple message queue server designed such that
it could be stood up with minimal effort.

Queute has a simple system of topics and posts. When a 
client subscribes to a topic, any post to that topic will 
be broadcast.

Queute is written in Rust with Tokio for maximum scalability
and efficiency.

Queute is completely free and open source.

Queute is WIP software and is not ready for production use. 
There are no current releases available.

Queute can be built from source or ran in a docker container.
